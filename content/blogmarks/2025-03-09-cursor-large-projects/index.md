Most of the twitter conversation about cursor has been about how it's a great tool for small projects. I think that's a shame, because I think it's a great tool for large projects.

Cursor is a powerful tool for maintaining large coding projects, helping developers code 5-30 times faster. The guide emphasizes the importance of an effective edit and test loop to improve code quality. By setting up proper documentation and workflows, engineers can leverage AI for refactoring, documentation, and project planning.

I love the ai folder specific to the project. I also appreciate how you can have Cursor run tests which isn't something I've done a lot of yet, but look forward to trying.
