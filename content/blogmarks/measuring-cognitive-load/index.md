A live article on measuring cognitive load by Artem Zakirullin. It's being cotinuously updated, but one clip that resonates with me is:
>Once you onboard new people on your project, try to measure the amount of confusion they have (pair programming may help). If they're confused for more than ~40 minutes in a row - you've got things to improve in your code.

With AI tooling, the amount of code is bound to grow. We should make sure to be cognizent of the cognitive load required to maintain it all.
