In this post I'll explore the world of AI art. I'll look at some of the tools and techniques that are being used to create AI art. I was inspired by Latent Space's recent podcast episode on AI art [here](https://www.latent.space/p/comfyui?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1084089&post_id=154105963&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=false&r=64io&triedRedirect=true&utm_medium=email).

## ComfyUI gives artists the most flexibility.
You use nodes and flows to build out workflows.

## Nature Language Model
My favorite example of AI art is the Refik Anadol's work. Most recently he built the [Large Nature Model](https://refikanadol.com/works/large-nature-model-living-art/) in collaboration with NVIDIA. It seems to be mainly aimed at clasisfying Flora, Fauna, and Fungi. My favorite work of his though is the Unsupervised work as part of the Machine Hallucinations. The nature version of that is beautiful and worth checking out. My goal as part of this research is to better understand techniques to potentially create the same effect with my own images.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
GANs are likely a core component of how Anadol creates these mesmerizing transitions. GANs are a class of AI algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. GANs are often used to generate new data that resembles the training data, such as images, videos, or sounds.
